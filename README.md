# **Software Efficiency Strategy Tips**
**Tami Green, PhD**

## Overview
This repository contains a proof of concept demonstrating how **compound functions** can improve software performance. The example compares traditional **nested loops** (O(n^2)) with an optimized **set-based lookup** (O(n)), showing significant efficiency improvements through a performance comparison graph.

## Why Compound Functions?
Traditional iterative methods like nested loops result in poor scalability and performance degradation as dataset sizes grow. **Compound functions** allow for more efficient operations, reducing redundancy and improving performance, as shown in this repository.

## How to Use the Code

**Step1.** Clone the Repository.  
First, download or clone this repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TamiGreen/Software-Efficiency-Strategy-Tips.git
```

**Step2.** Install Dependencies.  
Ensure you have Python installed. Youâ€™ll also need the matplotlib library to generate the graph. Install it using the following command:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

**Step3.** Run the Python Script.  
Now, run the provided Python script (compound_function_efficiency.py) to generate the performance comparison graph:
```bash
python compound_function_efficiency.py
```
**Step4.** View the Graph.  
The script will generate a graph comparing the performance of traditional nested loops versus the optimized compound function approach. The graph will be saved as a file named performance_comparison.png in your current working directory.

**Conclusion**
This repository demonstrates how compound functions can be applied in software development to improve performance and scalability, particularly for data-intensive operations. By optimizing data queries and other processes with compound functions, software systems can handle larger datasets with greater efficiency.
